# Clean++ Component Library

## Alan Weide, Paolo A.G. Sivilotti, and Murali Sitaraman

This library contains a (small) collection of software components written in the Clean++ Discipline.

Clean++ is a programming discipline that leverages C++ move semantics to ensure code is readable, efficient, and—most importantly—sound to reason about in a local, modular fashion. The three driving principles of Clean++ are:

1. Preserving the soundness of local reasoning
2. Preservation of good object-oriented programming practices
3. Familiarity to seasoned C++ programmers

For a detailed dive into the Clean++ discipline, see [our paper][paper link].
